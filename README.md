A minimalistic theme for obsidian publish. You can find an example of the theme on [this](https://rokosphoenix.com) site.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have configured a custom domain with obsidian publish. More information can be found on the [obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Set+up+a+custom+domain) docs.
2. Add the [publish.js](publish.js) and [publish.css](publish.css) files to the home directory of the vault you are publishing.
